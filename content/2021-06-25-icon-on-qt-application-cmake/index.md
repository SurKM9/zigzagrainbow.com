## Introduction

In the previous [tutorial](icon-qtapplication) we managed to simply set the application icon using QMake. In this tutorial, we will learn how to set the icon of an application using CMake scripts.

## Setup and Configuration

Before we can start writing CMake scripts we need to create a resource(.rc file). To create a .rc file, right-click in your current source directory where the CMakeLists.txt exists and choose a new document. Rename the new document to "appicon.rc". Open the .rc file in an editor and paste this line in it:

```JS
IDI_ICON1 ICON DISCARDABLE "appicon.ico"
```

Make sure **appicon.ico** exists in the current source directory as well. If you do not have a .ico file. You can create one [here](https://www.icoconverter.com/).

Now, we just need to add this .rc file in our CMake script like:

```JS

set(APP_ICON_RESOURCE_WINDOWS "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/appicon.rc")

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}
        WIN32
        main.cpp
        ${APP_ICON_RESOURCE_WINDOWS}
    )

```

When you build and run the application, you will see the icon on the top-left corner of the window, and also the icon is set on the executable(.exe) itself.
